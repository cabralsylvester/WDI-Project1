Technologies used: html, css, javascript, jquery.

Approach taken: I wireframed my idea, and then pared down according to what was reasonable with the time frame being what it was.

Unsolved problems: I tried to resize absolute files, but was unsuccessful, and so I ended up not including them.

User story

1. I built this Trivia game with the DC metro area sports fan in mind.

2. My objective was to engage these traditionally knowledgable fans/users with fun, simple questions.

3. In html, I chose a red colored background to "attract" and appeal to the traditional redskins fan.

4. I opted to keep the trivia game "short & sweet" bc users have short attention spans.

5. I chose the button layout based on some research I performed regarding empathetic, human-centered design.
